Influence of demographics and economics in the Swiss votations of 2014.

## Abstract

Swiss people are asked to vote for different law proposals each year. These proposals called « votations » cover a wide range of subjects. 
In this project the outcomes of the votations (participation rate, percent in favor) will be analysed regarding their thematic category and the political party that emited it. The relation between these results and demographics, economics and education level of each canton will be analyzed.

The goals of this project are :
<li>To create an interactive map, showing the results of the votation per can and per thematic category (votation about economics, immigration, education…) 
<li>To show statistical evidence that some denographics parameters could explain part of the votation outcome

## Data Description

## Feasibility and risks

## Deliverables

Interactive map of the swiss cantons.
Have as a background a demographics parameter (that the user will choose). Add on the map the outcome of the votations (the user can choose all votations or a thematic). 
Keep only the demographics for which we found a significant impact on the outcome.

## Time Plan


Timeplan:

Deadline : 21st November

2.	Statistical analysis : find relevant relations between the demographics and the votation outcome.
Deadline : 5 Decembre

3.	Visusalisation : Build the interactive map(s).
